        <p>Well just a guy who hopes to make his mama proud. Have a lot of love for tech and also hoping to
            learn all I can. I'm interested in learning web development as I would like to be a full-stack
            dev one day. While I feel like I lack the creative side to do frontend I do enjoy learning about
            the backend.
